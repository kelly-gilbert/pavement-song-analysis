Open up your hands and let me see the things you keep in there
I don't want to split up fifty-fifty that's the way we do it in this rose town

With your slip shag watching back
You skinny skinny people don't like that

"Slanted And Enchanted (1992)","I was dressed for success, but success it never comes
And I'm the only one who laughs at your jokes when they are so bad
And your jokes are always bad
But they're not as bad as this
Come join us in a prayer
We'll be waiting, waiting where
Everything's ending here
And all the sterile striking, it defends an empty dock you cast away
And rain upon the forehead where the mist's for hire if it's just too clear
Let's spend our last quarterstance randomly
Go down to the outlet once again
Painted portraits of minions and slaves, crotch mavens and one-night plays
Are they the only ones who laugh at the jokes when they are so bad?
And the jokes, they're always bad
But they're not as bad as this
Come join us in a prayer
We'll be waiting, waiting where
Everything's ending here
And all the Spanish candles unsold away have gone to this
And a run-on piece of mountain trembles, shivers, runs down the freeway
I guess she spent her last quarter randomly
I guess a guess is the best I'll do
Last time
Last time
Was the best time

And silence is danger, but it's not required here, so why you scared?

Mixing cocktails with a plastic-tipped cigar

You wear on the protein delta strip in an abandoned house
But I will wait there, I'll be waiting forever

Does it show when the ends are frayed
And it's tossed out
Lined with silver thread
I've seen your wasted beehive

Shoulda been a West coast bride

And pilots flying drive by fades

Salivate and reckon

The secondary stumbles
'Cause the cadence of the count has led them astray
Pray their intuition
Leads them crashing into bodies in a perfect way
But I, I saw you
Reeling in a parking lot
I, I saw you
Rally 'round a parking lot
Line up for the comfort and kick it on the bumper
No, there is no leeway
You're standing on the freeway in love
Motion, you were destined for the pauper's grave

Are like virgins with an itch they cannot scratch

Blurring up your eyes and your head
